### About
The game of life is a grid of cells where each cell is in the state of being alive or not. The next generation of the game depends on the current generation and the following rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation. 
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. 
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation. 
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
